active and piled achievements.
Achievements get put in the "bank" after the week you got it is over.
They get stored as a percentage bar.
Every week you add one of the achievements to the certain achievements "bank"
you also get a counter for how many achievements in total you have.
the weekly achievements gets added to its percentage bar. the total increases by 1 each week unless it is a monthly or a yearly achievement.
EG. if i got the typing with speed for one week. next week that achievement would be added to the percentage bar for it. and the cap of the amount rises by 1. then if i got it
again next week it would be added to the percentage bar the week after. and the cap and amount would be raised by 1 each time.

negative points for the number of files that are present in a sandbox that have not been committed in git. (multiplied by the length of time that they have been around).- if nagios
reports presence of file in "/etc/noquattor/" on host (and we determine when the file was created.) and we go through the security log to determine who was logged in at that time. if
only 1 person we will guess he created the file. if there is more than 1 person logged in its fine according to who owns the sandbox.
